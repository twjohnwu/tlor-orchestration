# Erebor Ledger (寶庫清點 — dispatch token/cost savings report)

> Named for the dwarves' vaults under the Lonely Mountain, where every coin
> is counted. This skill counts not gold but tokens: how much a dispatch to
> a tlor role actually cost, versus what it would have cost the
> orchestrator to do the same work inline.

## Purpose

Answers two independent questions, never merged:

1. When **Fable 5** is the orchestrator (main-session model), how much did
   dispatching to tlor-orchestration save versus doing the work inline?
2. When **any Opus version** (excluding Fable 5) is the orchestrator, what's
   the same answer?

Fable 5 and Opus have different unit prices and token-consumption patterns
— averaging them across groups would distort the savings estimate, so each
group gets its own report and its own totals.

## Data sources

Reads Claude Code transcript JSONL directly — no external API, no network
call:

- **Main-session transcript**: `~/.claude/projects/<proj>/<sessionId>.jsonl`
- **Subagent transcripts**: `<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl` +
  `agent-<agentId>.meta.json` (the `agentType` field maps a subagent
  transcript back to the role name it was dispatched as)
- Per assistant record: `.message.model` and
  `.message.usage.{input_tokens,output_tokens,cache_creation_input_tokens,
  cache_read_input_tokens}`
- `.message.model == "<synthetic>"` records are excluded from every total —
  they are never billed and never counted

These are internal Claude Code transcript fields, not a documented public
API — a CC version upgrade may rename or restructure them. If the fields
this skill reads don't match what's installed, `erebor_ledger.py` will
either error out or produce visibly empty reports rather than silently
guessing at a different schema; investigate and fix the field paths before
trusting a "clean" run.

## How to run it

```bash
python3 skills/erebor-ledger/scripts/erebor_ledger.py [--project SUBSTR] \
    [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--until YYYY-MM-DD] [--month YYYY-MM ...] [--detail-others]
```

- No flags: scans every project under `~/.claude/projects/` and its full
  history.
- `--project <substring>`: only includes project directories whose name
  contains this substring.
- `--since YYYY-MM-DD`: only includes records at or after this date, using
  the transcript's own `timestamp` field.
- `--until YYYY-MM-DD`: only includes records at or before this date, same
  field. Combine with `--since` for a closed date window; both bounds are
  inclusive.
- `--month YYYY-MM`: only includes records in that month, using the
  transcript timestamp's UTC calendar date (i.e. the month boundary is
  `ts[:7]` of that same `timestamp` field, not local time). Repeatable —
  pass it more than once for a multi-month comparison; mutually exclusive
  with `--since`/`--until` (the script errors out if both are given).
  (`--root` also exists as an advanced/testing override of the transcripts
  root directory — not part of the documented filters above, useful for
  running against a fixture directory instead of the real
  `~/.claude/projects/`.)
- `--detail-others`: off by default (see the mandatory format below for the
  default merged row). When set, breaks the merged `(other subagents)` row
  into one row per distinct non-tlor-role `agentType` (built-in Explore,
  `general-purpose`, plugin agents, ...), sorted by descending money saved
  (unpriced rows last, alphabetical among themselves); Total saved is
  unchanged either way.

Python 3 standard library only — no `pip install` required.

Run the script **once** per report and quote that single run's output —
never re-run it "to double-check" and never re-type or recompute numbers by
hand in the prose. Transcripts grow while a session is live (including from
the very dispatches producing this report), so two runs minutes apart give
slightly different totals; a report whose prose disagrees with its own
quoted raw output reads as fabricated even when both numbers were real.
This applies to multi-month comparisons too: passing `--month` more than
once produces every month's section PLUS the cross-month comparison table
inside that SAME single run — never stitch together separate single-month
runs by hand.

## Savings methodology

- **Actual cost** = Σ(each subagent assistant record's tokens × that
  record's own `.message.model` price)
- **Counterfactual cost** = the same token totals × the session's
  orchestrator-model price (i.e. "what if the orchestrator had done this
  work inline instead")
- **Saved** = counterfactual cost − actual cost
- input / output / cache_read / cache_write tokens are priced **separately**
  and summed — never a single blended rate

Every report **SHALL** carry this disclosure, verbatim or in equivalent
wording:

> Counterfactual assumes inline execution would consume the same token
> volume; this is an estimate, not a measurement.

It also discloses a pricing-tier assumption: Claude Code transcripts don't
record whether a cache write used the 5-minute or 1-hour cache tier, so
every cache-write cost in this report is priced at the 5-minute tier. This
is stated in the report output every run — never omit it.

It also discloses an effort-source assumption: Claude Code transcripts
don't record per-dispatch effort, so any `Effort` cell marked with a
trailing `*` comes from the role's pinned frontmatter (`effort:` in
`agents/<role>.md`), not an observed per-dispatch value. This is stated in
the report output every run — never omit it. The same pinned frontmatter
file also supplies the `model:` value a row's `Model` cell is compared
against to decide the `(upgrade)`/`(downgrade)` marker described above.

## Per-role table (mandatory format — do not invent a different one)

Every group (Fable / Opus) gets its own per-role table with this exact
column set and order — this is the implementation contract, not a
suggestion:

| Role | Model | Effort | Dispatches | input | output | cache(r/w) | Actual cost | Counterfactual cost | money saved | saved % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Rows are keyed by **(role, model, effort)**, not just role: a role
dispatched with a per-call model/effort override (per
`rules/dispatch.md` §3/§4 — e.g. an escalated retry) gets its own row,
adjacent to that role's other rows, sorted by descending money saved.
`Model` is the shortened `.message.model` id (`claude-` prefix and any
trailing date snapshot suffix stripped, e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` →
`haiku-4-5`), suffixed with ` (upgrade)`/` (downgrade)` when the row's
actual model family/tier (haiku < sonnet < opus < fable) differs from the
role's pinned frontmatter `model:` — e.g. an `eagle-sentinel` row actually
run on `sonnet-5` shows `sonnet-5 (downgrade)` because the role pins
`opus`; same family regardless of version (pinned `opus` vs actual
`opus-4-6`), no pin, or an unrecognized family on either side never gets a
marker. `Effort` is a recorded per-dispatch value if one exists, else
the role's pinned frontmatter marked with a trailing `*`, else `—`.

The nine tlor roles (`rohirrim-outrider`, `ranger-pathfinder`,
`noldor-loremaster`, `dwarf-smith`, `gondor-builder`, `eagle-sentinel`,
`elf-archer`, `orc-saboteur`, `hobbit-gardener`) each get their own row(s)
when they appear in the data; anything else (built-in Explore, a generic
subagent) is merged into a single `(other subagents)` row by default —
its `Model`/`Effort` cells show `mixed` unless every merged dispatch shares
one value (`--detail-others` splits these out per agentType, each further
split by model/effort like a tlor role). The last row is always
**Total saved**, with `—` in its `Model`/`Effort` cells.

### Example (illustrative numbers — the format is the contract, the numbers are not)

Fable group per-role example:

| Role | Model | Effort | Dispatches | input | output | cache(r/w) | Actual cost | Counterfactual cost | money saved | saved % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rohirrim-outrider | haiku-4-5 | low* | 12 | 8,400 | 2,100 | 15,000/3,200 | $0.42 | $3.10 | $2.68 | 86.5% |
| ranger-pathfinder | sonnet-5 | low* | 5 | 6,000 | 4,500 | 9,800/1,500 | $0.61 | $2.95 | $2.34 | 79.3% |
| noldor-loremaster | sonnet-5 | medium* | 2 | 3,200 | 1,800 | 2,000/500 | $0.28 | $1.10 | $0.82 | 74.5% |
| dwarf-smith | sonnet-5 | low* | 3 | 4,100 | 3,000 | 5,600/900 | $0.35 | $1.85 | $1.50 | 81.1% |
| gondor-builder | sonnet-5 | medium* | 4 | 9,000 | 6,200 | 12,000/2,100 | $0.90 | $4.20 | $3.30 | 78.6% |
| eagle-sentinel | sonnet-5 (downgrade) | medium* | 5 | 6,500 | 3,200 | 7,000/1,000 | $0.48 | $2.40 | $1.92 | 80.0% |
| eagle-sentinel | opus-4-8 | medium* | 1 | 1,000 | 700 | 1,000/200 | $0.07 | $0.40 | $0.33 | 82.5% |
| elf-archer | opus-4-8 | medium* | 1 | 1,200 | 900 | 600/100 | $0.10 | $0.55 | $0.45 | 81.8% |
| orc-saboteur | opus-4-8 | medium* | 1 | 1,300 | 950 | 700/100 | $0.11 | $0.58 | $0.47 | 81.0% |
| hobbit-gardener | opus-4-8 | medium* | 1 | 1,100 | 800 | 500/100 | $0.09 | $0.50 | $0.41 | 82.0% |
| (other subagents) | mixed | mixed | 2 | 2,000 | 1,000 | 1,000/200 | $0.15 | $0.70 | $0.55 | 78.6% |
| **Total saved** | — | — | **37** | — | — | — | **$3.56** | **$18.33** | **$14.77** | **80.6%** |

The Opus group's structure mirrors the table above exactly (same column
order); its numbers are computed separately and not duplicated here.

### Example — cross-month comparison (when `--month` is passed more than once)

A multi-month run appends this `## Cross-month comparison` section AFTER
every month's full per-role tables (Month A Fable → Month A Opus → Month B
Fable → Month B Opus → this table). Columns are the raw `YYYY-MM` values you
passed, one per month; the rows are fixed:

| Metric | 2026-06 | 2026-07 |
|---|---|---|
| Sessions | 8 | 21 |
| Dispatch count | 40 | 512 |
| Actual cost | $2.10 | $28.40 |
| Counterfactual cost | $9.80 | $92.15 |
| Saved | $7.70 | $63.75 |
| Saved % | 78.6% | 69.2% |

### Report assembly (mandatory — the comparison table never replaces the per-month detail)

The report you hand the user IS the single run's output, quoted in full and
in order — not a digest of it. Prose may add observations, but never
*replaces* a table:

- **Single month / date range**: reproduce both the `Fable` and `Opus`
  per-role tables (mandatory column order), their group summaries, and the
  per-project subtotals.
- **Comparison mode (`--month` passed more than once)**: reproduce EVERY
  requested month's full per-role tables first — Month A Fable → Month A
  Opus → Month B Fable → Month B Opus → … — and only THEN the
  `## Cross-month comparison` table. The comparison table is an addition on
  top of the per-month detail, never a substitute for it: a report that
  shows only the comparison table, or folds the months into prose, has
  dropped exactly the detail the user asked for.

Each group report also carries:

- **Group summary**: session count, orchestrator's cumulative tokens/cost for
  that group, and the group's Total saved
- **Per-project subtotal**: saved amount split out by `<proj>` directory

If a `.message.model` has no matching price entry (see below), its row's
cost cells print `N/A` instead of a dollar figure — never a `$0.00` that
could be misread as "no savings", and never a guessed number.

## Pricing (`references/model-prices.json`)

Config-driven, not hardcoded in the script. Matching is **longest-prefix
match**: a price-table key matches a `.message.model` id if the model id
*starts with* that key (e.g. a hypothetical `claude-opus-4-6` model would
match a `claude-opus-4` price-table entry, not require an exact match).

- Model id with no matching prefix → tokens are still listed normally, the
  cost column shows `N/A`, and the script prints a warning naming the
  unpriced model id. The script **never** substitutes another model's price
  for an unknown one.
- If a `claude-fable-5*` variant has no public pricing, its JSON entry uses
  `null` — a human SHALL fill in the real number (measured or officially
  announced) before that entry can price anything.
- Cache-write prices are quoted at the 5-minute cache tier only (see
  disclosure above) — if Anthropic's pricing model changes this, update
  `model-prices.json`, not the script.
- To add/repair a price, edit `references/model-prices.json` directly; do
  not hardcode prices in `erebor_ledger.py`.

## Before you report — checklist

Run through this before handing the report to the user; it guards the two
failure modes that have actually happened — a requested month silently
dropped, and a comparison run pasted without its comparison table:

- [ ] **One run only**: the whole report is the quoted output of a single
      script invocation (the run-once rule above); months were not stitched
      together by hand.
- [ ] **Every requested month reproduced in full**: for each month or date
      range the user asked for, both its `Fable (<month>)` and
      `Opus (<month>)` per-role tables are quoted in full in the mandatory
      column order — not summarized into prose, not replaced by the
      comparison table.
- [ ] **Comparison mode → comparison table too**: if you passed `--month`
      more than once, the `## Cross-month comparison` table is present in
      addition to (never instead of) the per-month tables, after them, one
      column per requested month.
- [ ] **Disclosures intact**: the counterfactual-estimate line, the 5-minute
      cache-tier line, and the `*` / `(upgrade)` / `(downgrade)` marker notes
      are all still in the output — never trimmed to save space.
- [ ] **No hand-recomputed numbers**: every figure in the prose matches the
      quoted raw output character-for-character.

## Non-goals

- Does not estimate the cost of a dispatch that hasn't happened yet.
- Does not write, delete, or modify any transcript or config file — read-only.
- Does not call any network API; all pricing comes from the local
  `model-prices.json`, refreshed by hand when Anthropic's pricing page changes.
