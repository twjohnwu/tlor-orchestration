An orchestration framework for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), themed
on Middle-earth. Nine pinned subagent roles with fixed model/effort/tools,
plus dispatch rules, setup skills, and opt-in guard hooks — everything an AI
coding session needs to delegate reliably.

## Skills at a glance

### Autoloaded (installed automatically with the plugin/agents)

| Skill | Purpose | When to invoke |
|---|---|---|
| `/rivendell-council` | Convene the adversarial panel (3 lenses, majority-survival verdict) | Irreversible ops, architecture decisions, root-cause verdicts, security judgments |
| `/tlor-init` | Install agents + rules + CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md routing + optional hooks | First-time setup, or upgrading an existing installation |
| `/tlor-restore` | Rollback to a previous installation from backup | An upgrade needs undoing |
| `/erebor-ledger` | Retrospective token/cost-savings report for tlor role dispatching, split by Fable-5- vs Opus-orchestrator sessions | "usage report", "cost savings report", "token ledger" — not for live in-progress cost estimation |
